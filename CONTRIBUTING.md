## üìã Guidelines

### Adding New Logos

When adding a new logo, please follow these guidelines:

#### 1. File Organization
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [category]/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _logo-name.scss
```

Categories:
- `corporate/` - Corporate and business logos
- `technology/` - Tech company logos
- `nonprofit/` - Non-profit organization logos
- `automotive/` - Car manufacturer logos
- `financial/` - Banks and financial institutions
- `retail/` - Retail and consumer brands
- `entertainment/` - Media and entertainment
- `airlines/` - Airlines and aviation
- `government/` - Government and public sector

#### 2. Naming Conventions
- File names: `_logo-name.scss` (lowercase, hyphenated)
- CSS classes: `.logo.logo-name`
- Historical versions: `.logo.logo-name.vintage-YYYY` or `.logo.logo-name.classic`

#### 3. Logo Implementation Standards

**Required Features:**
- Base logo implementation
- All size variants (icon, default, large, xl)
- Proper accessibility attributes
- Print styles support

**Recommended Features:**
- Historical versions when applicable
- Color variations
- High contrast mode support
- Responsive behavior

**Code Structure:**
```scss
// Logo Name Styles

.logo.logo-name {
  @include logo-base();
  // Base implementation
  
  // Historical versions
  &.vintage-YYYY {
    // Historical variation
  }
  
  // Color variations
  &.white {
    // White version for dark backgrounds
  }
  
  // Size adjustments
  &.icon {
    // Icon size adjustments if needed
  }
  
  &.large {
    // Large size adjustments if needed
  }
}
```

#### 4. Design Principles

- **Pure CSS Only**: No images, SVGs, or external resources
- **Scalable**: Must work at all defined sizes
- **Accessible**: Include proper ARIA labels and contrast support
- **Accurate**: Logos should be recognizable and reasonably accurate
- **Respectful**: Follow trademark guidelines and fair use

#### 5. Legal Considerations

- Only create logos for educational and development purposes
- Include proper attribution when required
- Respect trademark and copyright laws
- Add legal disclaimers when necessary

### Code Quality

#### SCSS Standards
- Use existing mixins when possible
- Follow the established variable naming convention
- Include comments for complex implementations
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)

#### CSS Output
- Ensure generated CSS is clean and efficient
- Test all size variants
- Verify accessibility features work

#### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (last 2 versions)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Test responsive behavior

## üß™ Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
2. **Test in browsers**: Open `examples/index.html` and verify your logo works
3. **Check all sizes**: Test icon, default, large, and xl sizes
4. **Verify accessibility**: Test with screen readers and high contrast mode
5. **Test responsiveness**: Check behavior on different screen sizes

## üìù Documentation

When adding a new logo, update:

1. **README.md**: Add the logo to the appropriate category section
2. **examples/index.html**: Add a demo of your logo
3. **Main SCSS file**: Import your new logo file

### README Format
```markdown
### Category Name
- **logo-name** - Company/Organization Name
  - `vintage-YYYY` - Description of historical version
  - `color-variant` - Description of color variant
```

## üé® Design Guidelines

### Color Usage
- Use CSS custom properties for brand colors
- Define colors in `_variables.scss`
- Support dark/light theme variations when applicable

### Shapes and Techniques
- Use pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for complex shapes
- Leverage CSS `clip-path` for intricate designs
- Use CSS gradients for color transitions
- Apply `transform` for rotations and positioning

### Accessibility
- Always include `role="img"` and `aria-label`
- Support high contrast mode
- Provide alternative content for print
- Respect reduced motion preferences

## üìã Pull Request Process
